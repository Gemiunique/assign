<!--HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages, while XHTML is a stricter and more standardized version of HTML.
XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
XHTML is almost similar to HTML but it is stricter than HTML
It is swift, accurate, easily maintained, convertible, and formatted
All major browsers support XHTML
1. HTML 1.0
The basic version of HTML has support for basic elements like text controls and images. This was the very basic version of HTML with less support for a wide range of HTML elements. It does not have rich features like styling and other things that were related to how content will be rendered in a browser.
The initial version of HTML does not provide support for tables, font support, etc., as it provides us in the latest version.
2.HTML 2
HTML version 2.0 was developed in 1995 with basic intention of improving HTML version 1.0
Now a standard got started to develop so as to maintain common rules and regulations across different browsers. HTML 2.0 has improved a lot in terms of the markup tags. In HTML 2.0 version concept of form came into force. Forms were developed, but still, they had basic tags like text boxes, buttons, etc.
Also, the table came as an HTML tag. Now, in HTML tag 2.0, browsers also came with the concept of creating their own layers of tags that were specific to the browser itself. W3C was also formed. The main intention of W3C is to maintain standard across different web browsers so that these browsers understand and render HTML tags in a similar manner.
3. HTML 3.2
It was developed in 1997. After HTML 2.0 was developed, the next version of HTML was 3.2
With version 3.2 of HTML, HTML tags were further improved. It is worth noting that because of W3C standard maintenance, the newer version of HTML was 3.2 instead of 3.
Now, HTML 3.2 has better support for new form elements. Another important feature what HTML 3.2 implemented was support for CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is CSS that provides features to make HTML tags look better on rendering it on browsers. CSS helps to style HTML elements.
4. HTML 4.01
It was developed in 1999. It extended the support of cascading styling sheets. In version 3.2, CSS were embedded in HTML page itself. Therefore, if the website has various web pages to apply to the style of each page, we must place CSS on each web page. Hence there was a repetition of the same block of CSS.
To overcome this thing, in version 4.01 concept of an external styling sheet emerged. Under this concept, an external CSS file could be developed, and this external styling file could be included in HTML itself. HTML 4.01 provided support for further new tags of HTML.
5. HTML5
This is the latest version of HTML. For a developer, it could be used in 2014. It came up with lots of HTML tags support.
DIFFERENT VERSION OF XHTML
XHTML 1.0 Strict
XHTML 1.0 Transitional
XHTML 1.0 Frameset
XHTML 1.0 Strict
The XHTML Strict document type forbids any markup elements and attributes that are used to control presentation, such as <center>, <font>, and color. The implication, of course, is that you should be using CSS to control all the presentational aspects of the page (which is a good idea, if possible). It also removes various deprecated elements and attributes, such as <applet>, <isindex>, target, and name.
XHTML 1.0 Strict is essentially HTML 4.01 Strict reworked as XML.
This document type is the best choice of the three, because it cleanly separates content from presentation. In many ways, it’s the “pure” version of XHTML.
XHTML 1.0 Transitional
XHTML 1.0 Transitional is more forgiving than XHTML 1.0 Strict, because it allows presentational elements and attributes — such as <center>, <font>, and color — in your markup, as well as deprecated features like <applet>, <is index>, target, and name.
XHTML 1.0 Transitional is basically HTML 4.01 Transitional reworked as XML.
This document type is useful if you want to move an HTML 4.0 Transitional (or earlier) website to XHTML as quickly as possible, since you can retain much of your presentation markup in the page. It’s also great for those times when you simply have to use the target attribute on a link!
XHTML 1.0 Frameset
The final XHTML document type available to you is XHTML 1.0 Frameset. This is simply XHTML 1.0 Transitional with added elements to support framesets: <frameset>, <frame>, and <noframes>. It’s essentially HTML 4.01 Frameset reworked as XML.

Needless to say, this is the document type to use if you’re building a framed website. To use it, add the following to the top of your site pages, before the <html> element:
